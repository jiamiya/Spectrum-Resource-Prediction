# Spectrum-Resource-Prediction
 
This is the course project of EE225: Intelligent Internet of things in SJTU.

Group members include Mingyang Jiang, Jinhao Feng, Han Yan, Letian Shen, Wenzhuo Zheng.

## File Structurre
logs/model: The recorded model files.

models: Different versions of our network implement.

utils: codes for data preprocessing and ploting.

## Visualization
A visualization of occupancy prediction on spectrunm resource, where the x-axis refers to index of bins(channels), and the y-axis refers to occupancy. A detailed defination about occupancy is in our report: https://github.com/jiamiya/Spectrum-Resource-Prediction/blob/main/report.pdf
